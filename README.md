# Transferbot
Experiment in conversational banking to learn about interaction using natural language.

A demo can be found at https://seriousme.github.io/transferbot/

The transferbot is composed of 3 parts:
- the AI, provided by https://api.ai
- the (very simplistic) banking backend hosted at https://firebase.google.com/
- the web front end hosted using gitHub pages, including voice recognition when using Chrome
